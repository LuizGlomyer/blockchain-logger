# blockchain-logger

An auditing system for the app _Restaurante UniversitÃ¡rio da UEA_ that logs messages securely over the Ethereum Network and generates reports of user interactions. This is the final project of my bachelor's degree in Information Systems. My undergraduate thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/LuizGlomyer/LaTeX/blob/master/Monografia/Monografia_Luiz_Glomyer.pdf) (in Portuguese).

 To run this project, you will need Docker. Firstly, build an image with the following command:

```sh
docker build -t blockchain-api-uea-ru .
```

Next, copy the file ```.env.example``` as ```.env``` and insert the needed environment variables.

Then run a Docker container based on the built image.
```sh
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 -v "$(CURDIR):/app" blockchain-api-uea-ru
```

Alternatively, you can just run:
```sh
make build
make run
```

To perform tests, run one of the following:
```sh
make test-unit
make test-integration
```
